# Fisher-Linear-Discriminant
Problem Statement:
You are required to design a Fisher’s linear discriminant classifier that can recognize scanned images of the 10 digits (0 to 9). 
The “Train” folder contains 240 images for each digit while the “Test” folder contains 20 images for each digit. 
The images in the “Train” folder should be used to train a classifier for each digit.
After the classifiers are trained, test each classifier using the images given in the “Test” folder.
